# Labels

Labels can be added to a map to show any information about an object. Any vector layer can have labels associated
with it. These labels rely on the attribute data of a layer for their content.  

The goal for this lesson: To apply useful and good-looking labels to a layer.  

## Using and Changing Label options

## Using Labels Instead of Layer Symbology

In many cases, the location of a point doesn’t need to be very specific. For example, most of the points in the places layer refer to entire towns or suburbs, and the specific point associated with such features is not that specific on a large scale. In fact, giving a point that is too specific is often confusing for someone reading a map.  

To name an example: on a map of the world, the point given for the European Union may be somewhere in Poland,
for instance. To someone reading the map, seeing a point labeled European Union in Poland, it may seem that the
capital of the European Union is therefore in Poland.  

So, to prevent this kind of misunderstanding, it’s often useful to deactivate the point symbols and replace them
completely with labels.
