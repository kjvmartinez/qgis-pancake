# Navigating the map canvas

This section will focus on basic QGIS navigation tools used to navigate within the Map Canvas. These tools will allow you to visually explore the layers at different scales.

## Basic Navigation Tools

1. Pan Tool

2. Zoom (Zoom out, Zoom last, Zoom Next, Zoom Full Extent)

3. Scale

The Scale value represents the Map Scale. In general, the number to the right of : represents how many times smaller the object you are seeing in the Map Canvas is to the actual object in the real world.
