* Change the water layer’s symbology again so that it has a darker blue outline.
* Change the rivers layer’s symbology to a sensible representation of waterways.

Remember: you can use the Open the Layer Styling panel button and see all the changes instantly. That panel also allows you to undo individual changes while symbolizing a layer.
